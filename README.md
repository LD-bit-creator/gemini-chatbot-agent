# gemini-chatbot-agent
This is a personal chatbot project that integrates Google's Gemini API with Chainlit to deliver an intelligent, real-time conversational experience. The goal is to demonstrate the practical implementation of LLM-powered chat interfaces using modern AI tools and frameworks.

Key Features

->LLM Integration: Connects to Gemini (via google.generativeai) for generating context-aware, natural responses.

->Interactive UI: Built using Chainlit to provide a seamless chat experience in the browser.

->Context Management: Maintains conversational state using Geminiâ€™s start_chat() functionality.

->Chat Logging: Saves full chat history in JSON format with role-based timestamps for each message.

->Secure Configuration: Uses a .env file for secure API key handling.

This chatbot showcases my ability to:

->Integrate third-party APIs and AI services

->Build real-time, event-driven applications

->Handle user input, error management, and data persistence

->Work with modern Python environments, virtual environments, and deployment-ready code
