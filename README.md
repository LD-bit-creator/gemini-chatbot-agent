# gemini-chatbot-agent
This project is a conversational chatbot built using Chainlit and Google's Gemini API. It provides an interactive web-based chat interface where users can engage with a Gemini-powered AI assistant. The app handles user input, manages conversation history, and stores chats locally as structured JSON for further analysis or persistence.
