    "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad field encompassing the development of computer systems able to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.  This includes things like:\n\n* **Learning:** Acquiring information and rules for using the information.  This can be through supervised learning (being explicitly told the right answers), unsupervised learning (finding patterns in data without explicit guidance), or reinforcement learning (learning through trial and error and rewards).\n\n* **Reasoning:** Using rules and facts to reach approximate or definite conclusions.\n\n* **Problem-solving:** Finding solutions to complex issues.\n\n* **Perception:** Interpreting sensory information like images, sound, and text.\n\n* **Language understanding:** Processing and understanding human language.\n\nAI is not a single technology, but rather a collection of techniques and algorithms.  Some common approaches include:\n\n* **Machine learning:** Algorithms that allow computers to learn from data without explicit programming.\n* **Deep learning:** A subset of machine learning using artificial neural networks with multiple layers to analyze data.\n* **Natural language processing (NLP):**  Focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.\n* **Computer vision:**  Enables computers to \"see\" and interpret images and videos.\n\nAI is rapidly evolving and impacting many aspects of our lives, from self-driving cars and medical diagnosis to personalized recommendations and fraud detection. However, it also raises ethical concerns about bias, job displacement, and the potential misuse of the technology.\n",
